            <p class="section" style="overflow-y:scroll; max-height: 80vh;">For my senior thesis project that took place
                for the last four months of my senior year, I decided to create my own video game with the intent of it
                being created in unity eventually. I decided on what type of game I wanted to make, that being a 2D
                platformer focusing on storytelling with games such as Celeste and Hollow Knight being my main source of
                inspiration. The first thing I did was map out my ideas on a potential world map layout with ideas
                sorted by location which was eventually cleaned up for iteration #2. The next issue I figured out was
                sizing for all of the art as I wanted to make sure it was scalable to multiple aspect ratios mainly
                being 1920x1080p. I decided to make the map 1/6th scale with tiles being 8x8 pixels. Character creation
                was then the main focal point once I had gotten the sizing down with multiple iterations being created
                for each one as shown in the image of my main character which was based on a wendigo. I then created a
                plot surrounding the map and characters I created based on the main character who has lost their
                memories and must look to restore it through collectibles called memory shards. The map and character
                interactions would then change based on how many shards have been collected with the character
                eventually remembering its name at the end of the game, something the player chooses. Dialogue trees
                were then created with different interactions leading to different outcomes each labeled on a
                spreadsheet. Level designs and backgrounds were the final piece created as levels were originally
                created in a single color to create what would be a collision barrier so the character can walk and be
                blocked by walls. It was then filled in with sprites textures based on the location of each block. I
                also had researched how the backgrounds of other games are created through the use of parallax
                backgrounds with multiple layers moving at different speeds. I added my own version of it to my game as
                seen in the video. Overtime, multiple ideas have been added as well as scrapped, even full characters
                which had been partially animated were never added to the final video. I still believe this project is a
                work in progress even though it has already been turned in as it is something I am continuing to work on
                my own.
