            <p class="title-section">Anthropocene</p>
            <p class="section">Anthropocene is a group project about human’s impact on earth’s ecosystem. Starting off as
                a book which was split into five sections, the section I chose was forest fires. Initially starting as a
                section about destruction as fires are usually seen as, eventually developed into a section more about
                rebirth which natural fires are seen as in many ecosystems. Major design elements such as the style of
                the title page for each section as well as the layout styles of some pages were created by myself and
                were replicated in other sections. Other products besides the book were also created such as stickers
                where each section created their own which I designed mine after a phoenix, a mythological creature
                known for death and rebirth.</p>
