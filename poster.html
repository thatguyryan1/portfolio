                <p class="about" style="margin-top: 6px;">Simera Festival is a collaboration project where one of the members simulates being a client while the other creates the poster. We were then instructed to interview and create a product that represents our client. For my client, I created a poster inspired off of 70s music festivals as listening to music and going to live shows were major hobbies for them. I then used the client's favorite colors, orange to create a color scheme that still represented the era I was trying to recreate. I then listed their favorite artists as well as other facts about them that were then shaped in the background around them.</p>
