            <p class="title-section">Cartoon Network Classics</p>
            <p class="section">Nostalgia was a major theme for this project as Cartoon Network was something I grew up
                watching all the time during my childhood. A question I then asked myself was “What made these cartoons
                different from modern day”. One major factor I found myself looking at was how these cartoons were
                animated with cell animation, something that is explored in the book which is the history of cell
                animated cartoons of cartoon network. I then created a product that featured such cartoons in a format
                that would have been found during the era, VHS. I created my own VHS box for the cartoons featured in
                the book as well as an advertisement. This advertisement for the VHS box was then uploaded and converted
                onto the vhs which can be seen inside the box as I believe I needed to keep the ability to watch it
                accurate to the era.
